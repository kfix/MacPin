# MacPin
<center>
MacPin creates pseudo-browsers managed with internal JavaScripts.  

![screenie](/dock_screenshot.png?raw=true "screen shot")  
</center>

the GitHub released apps are runnable under macOS 10.14.

While less featureful than Electron (no Node and Chromium here),   
they are [slim and fast like MacGap](https://discuss.atom.io/t/app-too-big/28845), thanks to use of macOS-shipped components.  

```
$ du -hs build/macosx-x86_64-apple-macosx10.13/apps/{Slack,MacPin}.app/
2.0M	build/macosx-x86_64-apple-macosx10.13/apps/Slack.app/  (mostly Assets.car icons)
4.0M	build/macosx-x86_64-apple-macosx10.13/apps/MacPin.app/ (icons + 1.5MB MacPin.framework)
```

## Project Status
Uses swift 5 & WKWebView.
`sites/**/main.js` tries to support some Electron idioms.  
* federation of the applet packaging using ES6 modules [is being explored](https://github.com/kfix/MacPin/issues/31)

Apps present within a semi-featured Browser UI, having just an ["OmniBox"](https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/omnibox) and tab buttons.  

MacPin-built apps are normal .app bundles that show in the Dock (or Springboard on iOS), tabbing App Switcher, & Launchpad.  

They are dependent on the core MacPin.app (4.5MB) to be registered on the system, since it contains the MacPin.framework.  
* future work could create an easy-button "exporter" to vendor the framework

Custom URL schemes can also be registered to launch a MacPin App from any other app on your Mac.  

Building `swift5.1` branch requires macOS 10.14 "Mojave" with Xcode 11.

All other branches are obsolete & archived for users locked on older macOS (hardware),  
but they will recieve no updates.

## Creating an App
Some call these Apps [Site-specific Browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser).  

"Psuedo-browser" has a better ring to it and MacPin tries to support "normal" browsing behavior,   
(address/status bars, middle-click, pop-ups) complementary to any scripts managing the app.  

```
cd ~/src/MacPin
mkdir sites/MySite
$EDITOR sites/MySite/main.js

# find a large & square .png for the app, like an App Store image.
# ideally it should have a transparent back field
cp ~/Pictures/MySite.png sites/MySite/icon.png

make test_MySite
# test, tweak, repeat

make install
open -a MySite.app
```

Work is ongoing to make editing and creating app scripts easier, without requiring Xcode:CLI tools.

## App porting issues

* DRM: Many sites (Spotify, Netflix) are using Chrome/FF only DRMs (Widevine) but Apple-built WebKit only supports FairPlay DRM.
* WebRTC: WebKit is compatible with [H264 & VP8 codecs](https://webkit.org/blog/8672/on-the-road-to-webrtc-1-0-including-vp8/), but Google Chrome is pushing hardware-unaccelerated VP9 on all fronts (incl. general <video>).

### sample main.js
```
/*eslint-env es6*/
/*eslint eqeqeq:0, quotes:0, space-infix-ops:0, curly:0*/
"use strict";

const {app, WebView, BrowserWindow} = require("@MacPin");

const browser = new BrowserWindow();

app.on('AppFinishedLaunching', function() {
	browser.tabSelected = new WebView({
		url: "http://vine.co",
		transparent: true
	});
});
```

## Hacking MacPin
Its written in Swift using WKWebView and NSTabViewController with a fully programmatic NIB-less UI layout.  
The AppScriptRuntime is purely based on JavaScriptCore's C and ObjC APIs.
MacPin's UI ClassTypes are bridged to ObjC by SwiftCore and once more into Javascript space using the JSWrapperMap facility in the Apple JSC.  
You need [Xcode 10](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on macOS 12.13+ to get the Swift compiler and Cocoa headers.  
`make` & `$EDITOR` are your hammer and chisel.  

```
vim modules/MacPin/*.swift
vim sites/MacPin/main.js
make test.app
# CTRL-D when finished debugging ...
```
The JavaScript API for `*.app/main.js` vaguely mimics Electron's `main.js`.  
If you want to play with it, run any MacPin app with the `-i` argument in Terminal to get a JS console (or `make repl`).  

Debug builds (`make test|test.app|repl`) can also be remotely inspected from Safari->Develop-><ComputerName>

Some things I just haven't had need to write, but wouldn't mind having:

* Global history
* Undo/redo for Tab closings
* UI wizard to generate MacPin apps from MacPin.app itself (no Command Line Tools or Xcode!)
  * maybe using JavaScript-for-Automation (JXA)?
* ReactNative, Vue/Weex, or NativeScript bindings in main.js for custom Browser UIs

#### use MacPin to make hybrid apps from existing projects
```
cd ~/src/SomeWebApp
test -d browser/SomeWebApp.com &&
  make -C ~/src/MacPin macpin_sites=$PWD/browser appdir=$PWD/hybrid xcassetdir=$PWD/hybrid $PWD/hybrid/SomeWebApp.com.app
open hybrid/SomeWebApp.com.app
```

#### iOS
Basic support exists for generating iOS apps, but its even moreso a Work In Progress (to teach me about the `UI*` classes)

its kinda pointless for most of `sites/*` since native apps exist for all of them.  
But maybe you want to quickly package a React.js application for offline mobile use...  

#### can i haz LinPin? WinPin?
Ok! A stubby port running `/Lin/main.swift + AppScriptRuntime()` using a ["JSConly"](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154512) [build](http://constellation.github.io/blog/2016/05/02/how-to-build-javascriptcore-on-your-machine/) of JavaScriptCore  
would be a good proof of concept for new MacPin platforms to spawn from.  

[(lol, y u no like V8 google?)](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2018-June/030045.html)

Swift runs on Lin/Win now and so do platform-ports of JavaScriptCore and WebKit, although without supported/prebuilt libs.  

However, ObjC bindings for both Swift and the WebKit frameworks are not enabled (or possible?) outside of macOS.  
So some additional pure-Swift bindings to the WebKit C/++ APIs will be needed before implementing symmetric platform-classes  
And a some refactoring in `AppScriptRuntime.swift` to totally strip it of ObjC...  

Also NSWindow & NSTabViewController aren't cross-platform but could be straightforwardly implement equivalent UIs from MFC or GTK.  
Swift bindings to those toolkits would also be needed.  

tvPin? No [WKWebView on tvOS](https://github.com/lionheart/openradar-mirror/issues/6085) *[officially](https://github.com/jvanakker/tvOSBrowser/master/_Project)*   

## Other WebKit browsers:

* [Electrino](https://github.com/pojala/Electrino): inspiration for the revamp of MacPin's `main.js`
* [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios/): another Swift-based browser for iOS.
* [Chrome for iOS](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ios/build_instructions.md)[*](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/ios/chrome/app/main_application_delegate.mm)
* [go-webkit2](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-webkit2)
* [Puny Browser](https://github.com/ahungry/puny-browser)
* [yue](https://github.com/yue/yue-sample-apps/tree/master/browser) on [Mac](https://github.com/yue/yue/blob/master/nativeui/mac/browser_mac.mm) & [Linux](https://github.com/yue/yue/blob/master/nativeui/gtk/browser_gtk.cc)
